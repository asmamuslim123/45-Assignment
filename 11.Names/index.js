// task # 10 (part 2) : Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least
//  one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because 
//  your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current 
//  date at the top of each
//  program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.
